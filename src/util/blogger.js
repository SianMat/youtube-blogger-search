To be able to tell the time or solve time problems, children need to have understanding in many different areas of mathematics. Although it can be difficult, if you take it one step at a time, learning to tell the time can be engaging and fun - it is a fantastic mathematical concept that can easily be linked to a child\'s real-world and time problems can greatly enhance their problem solving skills. This post talks about common misconceptions and difficulties that children may experience. It also highlights different areas of maths that are involved in learning to tell the time and ideas for activities that can be done at home or at school in order to improve a child\'s time-telling skills.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ca name=\'more\'\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cspan style="color: blue;"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cspan style="color: blue;"\u003e\u003ci style="color: #666666; font-family: calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;"\u003e(To see a full list of available posts click&nbsp;\u003ca href="http://kidsunderstandmaths.blogspot.com/p/posts.html" target="_blank"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv style="text-align: center;"\u003e\n\u003cspan style="color: black; font-size: large;"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003eMisconceptions / Difficulties\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cspan style="color: magenta;"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cspan style="color: black;"\u003eIf you stop to really consider time and think about what it would be like to look at a clock face (or digital clock) with no previous understanding of time, it is easy to think of many difficulties that you might come across.

When learning to tell the time, children need to be able to count an abstract concept; something that they cannot physically see. It is also a leap into continuous numbers - children need to comprehend that there is something between 1 and 2. Not only that, we are also now expecting children to count up to 12, and then start again at 1, rather than continue to 13. All of these concepts go against what we have been trying to get children to understand about numbers. It is important to be patient and appreciate that it is a big jump for children to be able to use and really understand numbers in such a different context than what they are used to. It helps if they have had practice counting other non physical quantities such as steps or (one of my personal favourites) the number of sleeps left until an exciting event.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cspan style="color: #274e13;"\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe day starts at 12 o\'clock\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/u\u003e - up until this point in a child\'s life, we have always started counting at 0 or 1, depending on the situation. However, now they need to learn that a day starts at 12 o\'clock and after an hour has passed we go back to 1 o\'clock. Even if you consider midnight to be 0 o\'clock, as some digital clocks do, there is still the issue that 11:59 is morning (am) but 12:00 is afternoon (pm) and one minute after 12:59 pm is 1:00 pm. I suppose you could overcome these difficulties by using 24 hour format, but then the child needs to understand that the 2 on the clock face represents 14 if it is in the afternoon. If your mind is a bit boggled now, imagine how a child must feel when first being introduced to the concept of telling the time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cspan style="color: #274e13;"\u003eThere are two of each time in a day \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e- not only does the day start at 12 o\'clock, but there are two of them in one day. Children need to recognise that the day is split up into two 12 hour chunks and, as a result, the hour hand on a clock will do two complete rotations in one day. They need to appreciate that 2 o\'clock can mean two different things and are at two very different times of day. This leads to the need to be specific about am and pm (or at least morning and afternoon). However, a young child may struggle with the concept of "2 in the morning", because to them that is in the middle of the night and not morning at all.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan style="color: #274e13; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"\u003eEach number on a clock has two meanings\u003c/span\u003e&nbsp;- when reading an analogue clock, the meaning of each number depends on which hand is pointing to it: for example, the 4 on a clock face represents 4 o\'clock when the hour hand is pointing to it but should be regarded as 20 minutes past when the minute hand points to it. This can be a very difficult concept for children to grasp - we are not only using number for a new, abstract concept but each number now has a double meaning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cspan style="color: #274e13; text-decoration: underline;"\u003eThe hour hand is usually between hours\u003c/span\u003e&nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e- children need to grasp the concept that although the hand is between the 7 and the 8 (for example) it is still \'something\' past 7. For example, at "5 to 8" the hour hand is almost touching the 8 but it is still 7:55 - to begin with many children think that this must mean 8:55 (as the hour hand is so close to the 8 that it may as well be on it). They need to perceive that the hour hand is constantly moving between the hours and that it doesn\'t suddenly jump to the next hour. However, this presents a lovely opportunity to emphasise how "5 to 8" is almost 8 o\'clock, as the hour hand is almost on the 8.&nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cu style="color: #274e13; font-weight: bold;"\u003e60 minutes in an hour &amp; 24 hours in a day\u003c/u\u003e&nbsp;-&nbsp;60 and 24 are not standard numbers that children will be used to using for grouping things.

However, it is actually easier to learn to tell (and really understand) the time on an analogue clock. The constantly moving hands help children to get a sense of the passage of time, and the numbers on the clock face help children block time into 5 minute intervals. The clock face also provides a visual picture of the current time: when the big hand is half way round, we can see that we are half past the hour. This is a really important concept for kids to get to grips with, as they have to get used to 60 being the whole hour, 30 being half and so on. It also means that at other points such as 10 past, it is easier to \'see\' what fraction of the hour has passed and will later help them link this to talking about "10 to" the hour, rather than 50 minutes past.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe following are the stages that children go through when learning to tell the time (with the approximate year in which they learn them, as described in a \u003ca href="https://www.busythings.co.uk/blog/teaching-children-to-tell-the-time-hints-and-tips/" target="_blank"\u003epost by busythings\u003c/a\u003e).

By colouring in each section a different colour, it really emphasises the 12 sections of a clock and can help children to become more aware that although the hour hand is constantly moving, it is still past the same hour until it moves into the next section.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nI first saw the idea of a double agent&nbsp;clock in \u003ca href="http://www.parents.com/kids/development/intellectual/learning-to-tell-time/" target="_blank"\u003e"Learning to Tell Time" by Karen Cicero from Parents Magazine\u003c/a\u003e. I think that it is a fantanstic idea that excites and engages children and helps them to get to grips with the two meanings of each number on a clock face. Essentially, it is about getting the children to realise that each number has a second, secret identity that comes out when the minute hand points to it.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nTo make a double agent clock, I like to make each number from 1 to 12 into a little door and behind each door is the second identity. This means that the clock face looks like a normal clock face, but to begin with children can look behind the door to check the second meaning. After a bit of practise, you can start asking the child to guess what is behind the door before checking (eventually, they won\'t need to look behind the door at all). The fact that the second meaning is hidden means that a child won\'t rely on just reading it off the clock face but will learn to remember and associate each number with its second meaning on their own. As a result they will then be able to tell the time on a normal clock that only has the numerals 1 to 12 written on it. (Later on, the clock face can be used to emphasise and practise the 5 times table.)\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv style="text-align: center;"\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style="text-align: center;"\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VFRTOHO3Qw" width="480"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cspan style="color: #274e13;"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003ePractise telling the time or showing the time on an analogue clock\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nStart with o\'clock first, making sure that you discuss the difference between am and pm and the fact that there are two of each time in the day.

Use the clocks that the children have made so that they are physically able to move the hands round - this will link to the words that they are using. Once the kids have a strong grasp of this it is not too big a leap for them to move on to telling the time to the nearest 5 minutes, especially with a double agent clock. It may be more difficult for them to describe a time as "25 to" rather than 35 past, but this will come with time (and frequent reminders).

Even if they remember the method correctly, they may not be able to apply them to other situations, such as when you go over an hour, or through 12 o\'clock. Instead, let the children develop their own strategies, and use their discussions and ideas to lead them towards methods that will always work, no matter the problem.&nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\nThe children can use the clock they made earlier to physically move the hands, and keep track of how much they have moved each hand.

Of course, this is another new concept for kids to understand, as it is essentially linearising time. However, if they have a good concept of the hours in a day (1 comes after 12) and how many minutes are in each hour, the transition should not be too tricky. You can start with labeling the hours on a number line and then filling in the major intervals between each hour. It is important to finish drawing the number line before attempting the problem, otherwise many children start drawing irregular intervals to suit the question, which doesn\'t help to accursolve the problem. Perhaps encourage children to make and keep a time number line that they can keep coming back to whenever solving time problems.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\nWhen using a time number line, children are able to make jumps that they are comfortable with (hours, half hours, 5 minutes) until they are close to the answer. They can then make jumps of a minute at a time until they get to where they need to be. All they then need to do is add up all the jumps. The good thing about this method is that it can be adapted for the use of all sorts of time problems including going forward in time, going backward in time and finding the difference between two times.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cspan style="color: #274e13;"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003eDiscuss the Circular Nature of a Clock\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nDiscussing and helping children to understand why a clock is circular can help them to more easily create time number lines and linearise time problems. Asking children why they think we use a circular clock to tell the time encourages them to think about how specific times are repeated, even though time has elapsed and we are in a new hour or a new day. It will emphasise that there are 60 minutes past every hour before time moves on to the next hour and the minutes start again at zero. &nbsp;It will also help children to think about how the hours are repeated twice a day, everyday. This aids children\'s understanding of the repetitive pattern of time which will, in turn, support the process of learning to tell the time. The children should be able to &nbsp;come to the conclusion that a time number line would have to go on forever, as time never stops but using a circular clock allows us to repeat the times each day.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cspan style="color: #38761d;"\u003eTelling the time can be a very difficult concept for children to really understand. There are so many different things that they must get to grips with and a lot of&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;for misconceptions to arise. However, children are often very keen to understand and talk about time and if we help them develop a good sense of time and how this is represented on an analogue clock, learning about time can be a very fun and engaging process.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n',

This post covers the early introduction to addition and subtraction with ideas for tasks that help children to really understand the process and the link between the two.

There are two main ways of visually representing an addition problem; the first is to think of it as combining two sets (such as two piles of sweets for youngsters) and the second is to imagine extending an initial length by a second length (such as on a number line).

This statement is dangerous and should be avoided. Instead of telling children to always start with the larger number, talk about the numbers as parts and totals (for example with 3 + 5 = 8, 3 and 5 are the parts and 8 is the total) and then tell the children that they must always start with the total.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003ch3 style="text-align: left;"\u003eSo much more than just adding or subtracting\u003c/h3\u003eA deep understanding of the basics will make moving on to more difficult concepts (such as adding/subtracting fractions or negatives) a much smoother process.

Avoid using mathematical symbols until the children are confident with the process; this encourages them from the start to use addition and subtraction to solve \'real-life\' problems, rather than the other way round.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv style="text-align: center;"\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v4mRfvXXUHI" width="480"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cspan style="color: black;"\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ch3 style="text-align: left;"\u003eIntroduce the mathematical symbols\u003c/h3\u003eIn order to understand and write addition and subtraction equations, children need to know the \'+\', \'-\' and \'=\' symbols. The \'+\' and \'-\' symbols can be introduced using the language from the last task but the \'=\' symbol needs special emphasis. I have seen the equals symbol used incorrectly by students of all ages and at all stages of learning. It is a fundamental principle that many students do not fully understand and it makes many other areas of mathematics a lot more difficult.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e Encourage children to write mathematical equations from images and \'real-life\' problems and use language that will help them understand and visualise the problem they are trying to solve. It is important to get children to write their own number sentences from pictures, rather than using pictures to help solve equations. For example, present children with a picture of two bunches of flowers and ask them for the total number of flowers. Encourage them to create their own equation to record the maths they have done in solving it. This encourages them to think of addition and subtraction equations as tools for solving and recording problems and will help them apply number sentences for future, more difficult problems.

When using a number line, children will start to realise that they can start at the first number, rather than having to count from zero up to that number, as they would with objects. This also offers the opportunity to explore starting with either number first and then adding on the other. Not only is this another confirmation of the commutative nature of addition, children will realise that it is quicker and easier to start with the larger number first. This, in turn, will improve a child\'s ability to be able to perform mental addition. Adding and then subtracting the same number (or the other way round) is another practical activity that allows children to see that you end up where you started and that one operation is the opposite to (undoes) the other.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAlthough some of the other methods may be more visual and intuitive for young children, I believe that using a number line is an important concept for children to understand.

This strategy works well, especially for small\nnumbers, but it is much more efficient if the child realises that they can\nstart with (a quantity of) 4 and then add 3 more to it. To begin with, they\nwill realise that they can start at 4, but may still need to count on 3 more\n(5, 6, 7) before getting to the answer. However, this has already saved them\nhalf of the work.

Each time before counting, ask the child to look at the group and tell\nyou how many they have (they will probably just say "lots" or\n"not too many" or something of the sort but at least they are\nthinking about \'how many\' there are). After counting ask the same question,\nreiterating that each of the groups contains five items.

You can then\nask the children &nbsp;to match the visual representation to the correct\nnumeral. This really helps the child to link the way we write a number to the\nphysical quantity that it represents.

If you give the child\nphysical objects to add and take-away, it is a counting exercise but also\ndevelops their understanding of addition as combining two quantities and\nsubtraction as taking one quantity away from another. The important point of\nthis task is that it is the total that you are interested in. When you ask the\nchild to tell you how many they have after adding two groups, they may count\nthe objects (starting at 1) but they only need to tell you the total. If the\nchild is able to understand this then they are beginning to understand\ncardinality.

If they are used to it, kids will also\nautomatically practise counting on their own. When counting, try to ask\nquestions every now and again that require the child to consider numbers that\nare one more or one less.
