# Search My YouTube and Blogger

## Introduction

This project was an app I decided to make to practice with React and third Party APIs. The desktop app allows users to select a search term from a drop down menu and view relevant results from either of my YouTube channels or my blog.

## Technologies

- React
- Javascript ES6
- HTML5
- CSS
- Google API
- Deployed with Surge

## Launch

Click on [website link](http://proud-lunch.surge.sh/ "Search My Stuff").

## Scope of functionalities and limitations

This app searches my channels and blog and allows for up to three channels/blogs to be searched. To adapt this for other use, channel and blog IDs can be changed. More results could be added in but CSS would need to be adapted. The app has not been optimised for mobile. The app uses local storage to store search results and avoid too many calls to the API. However, this means that if any new content is added, it will not show up without first clearing the local storage.

## API Key

The API keys in this code were deleted upon making this code public. To use the code yourself, you will need to generate your own API keys with Google API and insert into the code.

## Future improvements

- Adapt app to make it suitable for mobile devices
- Adapt code to make it more versatile - allow for more channels or blogs to be searched and make it easier to adjust what channels and blogs are being searched
- Add in a searchbar to allow users to type in their own search term
