# Search My YouTube and Blogger

## Introduction

This project was a learning exercise to start working with React and third Party APIs. The desktop app allows users to select a search term from a drop down menu and view relevant results from either of my YouTube channels and my blog.

## Technologies

- React
- Javascript ES6
- HTML5
- CSS
- Google API

## Launch

Click on [website link](https://60326f38b87c1f0007648baf--jovial-brahmagupta-7a0be8.netlify.app/ "Search My Stuff").

## Scope of functionalities and limitations

This app searches my channels and blog and allows for up to three channels/blogs to be searched. To adapt this for other use, channel and blog IDs can be changed. More results could be added in but CSS would need to be adapted. The app has not been optimised for mobile.

## API Key

The API keys in this code were deleted upon making this code public. To use the code yourself, you will need to generate your own API keys with Google API and insert into the code.
